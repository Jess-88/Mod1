       <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <em>look</em> happy, 
        but he's a <em>little</em> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
    </p>
<br>
<p>Jack would really like...
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades </li>
        <li>Majic Tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon </li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
